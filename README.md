## Wine dataset analysis
The dataset explores red and white variants of Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.

* Exploratory analysis was performed on the cleaned and transformed Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine data.
* Clustering of data with the k-means algorithm was performed, and Elbow and Silhouette Methods were used to define the number of clusters (k). The proportion of erroneously clustered data is determined.
* Classification of data with the KNN algorithm to predict the wine type based on the input variables was performed.
